				<h1>Who we are</h1>
				<p>Project HomeBlock was created in response to the pandemic flight of refugees fleeing the intensified sectarian conflict of the Syrian Civil War. The humanitarian challenges that arose from the massive influx of asylum seekers in Europe brought the world's attention to a global problem. Not only has the hardship of Syrian refugees been brought into the spotlight, but the broader issue of displacement and widespread homelessness has been made strikingly clear. By providing affordable and space-conscious housing, we aim to supply temporary shelter to those in transit, waiting to be approved for asylum, or hosted in under-developed countries.</p>
				<h2>The Facts</h2>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL5_hxh5F5Q7hb5G9RCIT7MGfeBfwqBFtV" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<ul>
					<h5>Syrian Refugees:</h5>
					<li>In 2005, the United Nations estimated that nearly 1 billion people worldwide lacked adequate housing, while over 1 million of those had no homes at all.</li>
					<li>According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 59.5 million people currently live in forcibly displaced 	conditions and 19.5 million are classified as refugees.</li>
					<li>Developing countries are burdened with 86% of the worldâ€™s refugees- a number that continues to climb annually.</li>
					<li>An average of 42,500 people per day are forced to leave their homes 
					because of conflict and/or persecution.</li>
					<h5>Homeless People In General:</h5>
					<li>1 out of every 4 homeless persons is a child under the age of 18.</li>
					<li>42.6% of the homeless are disabled and unable to work.</li>
					<li>Over 57,000 veterans are homeless.</li>
					<li>There are fewer places for poor people to rent than before. About 12.5% of the United States' supply of low-income housing has been permanently lost since 2001.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Our Goal</h2>
				<p>While this organization and was created in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, this website is also catered to the homeless, particularly in those in the United States where this website is hosted. HomeBlock's goal is to provide those without a home access to shelter and modular housing, housing that is possible to be constructed through assembly, somewhat like lego bricks. These houses may be temporary and small, but it is better than sleeping outside. The houses are easy to construct, but they are expensive to manufacture and ship, and this website's goal is to raise awareness and funds to give to those in need. These funds will be given to charities and organizations catered to providing aid to these people, and also to raise money to provide these people with modular housing.</p>
				<h2 id="modular-housing">What is modular housing?</h2>
				<p>Modular homes are off-site houses, built up by pre-constructed sections that are connected to eventually create a house. As these sections remind us of blocks, it gave us the idea for the name of our company and website: Project HomeBlock. These sections of the house are shipped over to those who need them, giving them shelter for them, their families, and several other homeless.</p>
				<h2>Other functions of this site</h2>
				<p>Modular housing is a very idealistic goal, but it is not the only way to help ease the issue of homelessness. This website also features an option to volunteer to take a homeless person into one's home. I know one may be a bit skeptical or paranoid about taking a homeless person in, so we ensure that each homeless person that will be taken in by a volunteer has been checked for previous crime records and drug history.</p>
				<p>We also accept donations to help the homeless and refugees, as volunteering to take in a homeless person/refugee or purchasing a modular home for those in need is an unrealistic option. Therefore, we will be accepting donations that will be 100% sent to charities and organizations that help the homeless, give them shelter, and provide aid to Syrian refugees. Many of our donations go to:</p>
